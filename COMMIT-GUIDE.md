# 🌟 Git Commit Emoji Guide

Use this guide to write consistent and expressive commit messages using emojis.

| Emoji | Type       | When to Use |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| ✨    | `feat:`     | For adding a new feature
| 🪲    | `fix:`      | For fixing a bug or unintended behavior
| 🎨    | `style:`    | For changes that don’t affect logic (e.g., formatting, CSS tweaks)
| 🔥    | `refactor:` | For code changes that improve structure without changing behavior
| 🧹    | `chore:`    | For routine tasks, config changes, or temporarily hiding features
| 📝    | `docs:`     | For writing or updating documentation or code comments
| 🧪    | `test:`     | For adding or editing tests
| 🚚    | `move:`     | For moving, renaming, or reorganizing files
| 🚧    | `wip:`      | For work in progress commits that aren’t finished yet
| ⏪    | `revert:`   | For reverting previous commits
| 🚀    | `deploy:`   | For deployment-specific changes

### Example Messages:
- `✨ feat: add create album form to bulk-upload page`

### Tips:
